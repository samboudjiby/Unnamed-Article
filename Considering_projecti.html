<div class="ltx_p">Considering projection, all of the models through Climate Wizard
predicted a trend of rising annual mean temperatures throughout the rest
of this century, although the magnitudes of change varied among models
and emissions scenarios. Presumably, that unanimity in the basic
prediction of future warming largely reflects the well-documented
influence of rising greenhouse gas concentrations on global atmospheric
temperatures.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">For B1 scenario ranging close to 0.99°C and 2.58°C are lower than those
for A2 scenario, which range 1.47° C and 3.39°C by mid-century. Also by
the end of the century for B1, ranging close to 1.2°C and 3.18°C, are
lower than those for A2, which range close to 2.57°C and 5.33°C.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Table 2 and 3 summarizes the predictions for 21 st century warming in
Lake Guiers Basin produced by each of the models for low (B1), moderate
(A1B) and high (A2) emissions.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">It is important, however, to remember that all projections of future
trends come with caveat that year to year fluctuations will also push
temperatures well above or below [2-2]. This mean that changes from
year to year will sometimes be more dramatic than long term trends.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Climatic “extremes” are also expected to become more common as the
world warms [1-3], but this does not necessarily mean that every
aspect of variability will increase in Lake Guiers Basin.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In summary, model ensemble average annual temperature are likely to rise
1.62°C and 3.61°C by the end of the century. One might also speculate
that significant warming is most likely to occur during March, April,
Mai on the basis that during these months, the region is strongly
influenced by air masses that move down from Saharan region (Mauritania)
where warming rates generally exceed the global average; Lake Guiers
Basin might therefore be exposed to this. It therefore will have
significant impacts to evaporation rates in the Lake. Such arguments,
however, are only tentative, and when considering future climatic
changes on a local scale it is wiser to anticipate a likely range of
possibilities than focus too heavily upon a single anticipated outcome.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In addition, we didn’t look at temperatures seasonality, because the
consistency among climate model projections for seasonal-scale changes
is much weaker due to inherent limitations in the ability of AOGCMs to
simulate short-term climate conditions, especially on local geographic
scales [28]; [29].</div>

<div class="ltx_p">All models project a greater amount of change as compared to the
1961-1990 baseline average.</div>
