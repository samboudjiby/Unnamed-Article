<div class="ltx_p">Lake Guiers water level is regulated to 2.5 m since the Diama Dam, 50 Km
from the river mouth to the Atlantic Ocean and 100 Km downstream from
the Senegal River and Lake Junction, was built. On this level, the
volume is estimated to 600 Million m3 [17-4]. The changes in water
level depended on evaporation and pumping rates for irrigation (1088640
m3/day) and urban water supply (185000 m3/day) [18].</div>

<div class="ltx_p">The climate of Lake Guiers Basin is similar to much of the Sahel and
characterized by two main seasons: a dry season that lasts nine months
from October to June, and a rainy season of three months. Total annual
rainfall is both low and highly variable, with an average of 225 mm per
year from 1982-2012. The mean annual temperature oscillates around
27.6˚C and fluctuates between a maximum average of 30.6˚C in the month
