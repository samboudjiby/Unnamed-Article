<div class="ltx_p">5. Discussion</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The main objective of this study was to examine climate evolution in
Lake Guiers Basin, by applying -using RClimDex program to detect recent
trends and AOGCMs through Climate Wizard to predict future climate.
Results show that a warming trend is noted (both in past and future
projections), with higher maximum air temperature and extremes. Warm
days are more (less) frequent. Heat waves, i.e., periods with high
maximum air temperatures, are becoming longer.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">AOGCMs warming projections may range between 2.57°C - 5.33°C by the end
of the century. Although A2 represents an extreme situation relative to
the B1 case, it represents a situation in which atmospheric CO2
accumulation continues at gradually accelerating rates over the course
of this century. Because Lake Guiers Basin has already experienced a
warming of 1.05°C during the last two decades, it is therefore
reasonable to conclude that the A2 path might produce an additional
warming close to what most models suggest by century’s end.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Furthermore, because we do not yet know how greenhouse gas emissions
will change in future, we cannot be sure of exactly how much
temperatures will rise, only that the general direction of change will
be that of warming throughout the present century.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The model simulations presented in this study nonetheless allow us to
estimate the range of annual-scale warming in Lake Guiers Basin that is
most reasonable to expect and prepare for.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In terms of precipitations, we detect an increasing PRCPTOT trend on a
rate of (+6.17 mm/year) particularly since 2000s. Heavy rainfall events
have become stronger, i.e., associated with a higher volume of rainfall
each year, or they are becoming more frequent, or both. Does this mean
we are at the start of the recovery period?</div>


<div class="ltx_p">[9-2] found that it is impossible to answer this question using
statistical method, especially trend detection methods. Interpretation
of detected linear trends requires long time series data set especially
when you are dealing with climate variability. Or, the period covered by
the observations is still too short to resolve the question of whether
there is now a trend towards wetter conditions. [32], found that
there has been some “recovery” in western part of Sahel with respect
to the very dry conditions that prevailed during the 30 years 1968–97.
However, the recovery was generally weaker in August (which is generally
the wettest month) than during the season as a whole.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Climate variability is known to be high in the Sahel, and studies such
as that of [9-3] highlight an inconsistent linear trends in
Senegalese rainfall indices; [32-2] attributed a large portion of
this to multi-decadal sea surface temperature variability and [33]
attributed it to the multi-decadal variability of rainfall in the Sahel.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Precipitation is extremely variable in space and time, and future
precipitation patterns are therefore more difficult to model and predict
than temperature trends. Most, of the AOGCMs predict a significant
decrease in annual precipitation in Lake Guiers Basin by century’s end,
although the magnitudes of change varied among models and emissions
scenarios. This trend is more marked by end century in A1B scenario
(-11.56%) and A2 (-15.43%).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Temperature rise will affect the water balance by enhancing potential
evapotranspiration (2102.43 mm/year) in the Basin. This effect will be
more severe when combined with the decrease of precipitation. In
general, the future climate of Lake Guiers Basin seems to be exposed to
more severe conditions and water availability will be under much greater
stress. Ensemble model projections show by the end of this century
-15.43% decrease in precipitation and up to 3.6˚C of temperature rise
in A2 scenario</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The accuracy of these forecasts is impossible to ascertain in advance
because we did not screen models by testing their ability to reconstruct
known climatic conditions in the past.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">This kind of problem is typical of many such models, which owing to
their relatively coarse spatial resolution (order of a few hundred
kilometers), are often not suitable for simulating detailed regional
weather and climate patterns [34]. Thus a Regional Climate Model
(RCM) driven by different AOGCMs is perhaps the most significant current
requirement from a hydrological perspective in the climate community
[12-2].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">We are therefore far less certain of what the future holds for Lake
Guiers Basin in terms of precipitation than we are for temperature.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In summary, it seems reasonable to expect total annual precipitation in
Lake Guiers Basin to decrease by as much as 2–25% by the end of this
century, though the models conflict in those projections more than they
do for temperature.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Although total annual precipitation is expected to decrease during this
century under an A2 emissions scenario, according to most models, it
remains unclear how that decrease will be distributed throughout the
year. It is also possible that the average intensity and frequency of
heavy precipitation events could increase over time, and that short-term
droughts could become more frequent as evaporation rates increase with
warming, even if rainfall does not change much [29-2]. This lack of
consensus among model projections is unfortunate because the seasonality
of precipitation can be even more ecologically important than the total
annual amount.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Finally, it is important to consider that all of the climatic trends
described in this study will be accompanied by potentially large
short-term fluctuations from year to year and decade to decade. It is
therefore wiser for water resource manager in Lake Guiers Basin to
prepare for a wide range of climatic conditions in the future than to
expect a single, smooth pattern of change.</div>
