<div class="ltx_p">In order to determine how climatic patterns within Lake Guiers Basin
have changed in the recent past, we analyzed the local weather records
from the Sugar Cane Company (CSS) climatic stations network within the
Lake. Most weather datasets contain flaws due to gaps in coverage,
changes in instrumentation, and inconsistencies in the number and timing
of daily observations. Simply using their raw data for analysis
therefore may produces spurious results. The database currently includes
records from more than 8 stations. For our analysis, the records were
averaged together to produce mean values for the basin as a whole. The 8
stations located within Lake Guiers are indicated on Map (figure 1). A
short period (less than 30 years -“climatic normal”) of daily record
(1988–2012) of maximum and minimum air temperature, total daily
rainfall has been analyzed. This period is chosen for indices
calculation because the selected stations are those with less than 2%
of missing data.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Twenty five core indices of climate extremes across Lake Guiers basin,
were calculated.<b>Table1</b>, present the results and definition of
indices used in this study) with RClimDex (1.0) program [13-2],
using p-values up to 0.05 to indicate statistical significance.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">RClimDex is designed to provide a user friendly interface to compute
indices of climate extremes. It computes all 27 core indices recommended
by the CCI/CLIVAR Expert Team for Climate Change Detection Monitoring
and Indices (ETCCDMI) as well as some other temperature and
precipitation indices with user defined thresholds [13-3].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">These indices characterize aspects of the tails of the distribution (The
“extremes”) since these tend to be more relevant to society and
natural system [23]. In regards to indices calculation, we define as
assumption, upper threshold of daily maximum temperature, 35°C; upper
threshold of daily minimum temperature, 20°C; daily precipitation
threshold, 25 mm. In order to show the recurrent features of
precipitation in Lake Guiers Basin, we also calculate the Standardized
Precipitation Index (SPI) [24].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">With regards to present and past evaporation of Lake Guiers Basin, Etpot
was calculated from meteorological data by means of the FAO
Penman-Monteith equation (Allen &amp; FAO, 1998). The meteorological data
(maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, maximum Relative
Humidity, minimum Relative Humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation in
W/m2) of Lake Guiers Basin were extracted from global weather data for
SWAT (http://www.globalweather.tamu.edu/). In comparison to ETpot PM,
historical ETpot data from CORDEX was also calculated using Hamon
equation. To avoid overestimation of ETpot, the Correction Factor (CF)
was calculated. CF = Etpot_PM / Etpot_Hamon. Finally ETpot was
estimated from Hamon equation.</div>
