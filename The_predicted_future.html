<div class="ltx_p">The predicted future climate conditions significantly increase potential
evapotranspiration (Table5). By end century ETpot is projected to
increase, as compared to ETpot (1988-2011) baseline, up to 2538.80
mm/year under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 2916.82 mm/year under RCP 8.5
scenario. However by mid-century potential evaporation as compared
(1988-2011) baseline ETpot is projected to decrease reaching up 2020.88
mm/year under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 2052.55mm/year under RCP 8.5
scenario, until 2030.</div>
