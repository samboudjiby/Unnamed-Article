<div class="ltx_p">Model simulations of precipitation changes for the Sahelian regions are
strongly divergent and most models fail to reproduce realistic inter
annual and inter decadal rainfall variability in the Sahel in 20th
century simulations [11-2]. Our understanding of the processes
causing tropical rainfall is insufficient to allow a prediction of the
direction of change with any certainty. The IPCC identify this as an
area requiring further research to understand the variety of model
responses in this region [31].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">4.1.3. Evapotranspiration</div>


<div class="ltx_p">A further important factor is, especially in the Sahel with high
temperatures and less precipitation, the loss of water through
evaporation. Temperatures in Lake Guiers Basin are high during whole the
year and register strong winds and low air humidity. These atmospheric
variables contribute for high evaporative rates. Table 4 show potential
evapotranspiration in Lake Guiers from 1988 to 2011 calculated using FAO
Penman Monteith method and Hamon method. The results of both methods
show significant difference in ETpot. This Difference is likely due to
the change in ETpot model from Penman Monteith (PM) to Hamon. To avoid
overestimation of ETpot, a correction Factor (CF) was calculated and
then ETpot was estimated (table 4.). The amount of water lost to the
atmosphere through evapotranspiration is estimated to 5.74 mm/day
(2102.43mm/year).</div>
