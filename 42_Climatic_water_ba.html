<div class="ltx_p">Climatic water balance characterizes the concurrent availability of
energy and water for biota and is represented here by climatic water
deficit. Deficit (DEFF), a proxy for drought, represent the unmet
atmospheric demand components of the climatic water balance.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Table 6 show the monthly and annual climatic water balance (1988-2011)
in Lake Guiers Basin. The annual estimated deficit remain high (1781.43
mm/year). This deficit is more marked during the months of March and
April (236.84mm and 239.7mm respectively).Warmer temperatures, combined
with increases in wind and decreases in humidity, increase potential
evapotranspiration (2102.43mm/year) over the Basin.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Temperature rise will affect the water balance by enhancing potential
evapotranspiration in the Basin. This effect will be more severe when
combined with the decrease of precipitation (table 5). In general, the
future climate of Lake Guiers Basin seems to be exposed to more severe
conditions and water availability will be under much greater stress.
Ensemble model projections show by the end of this century -15.43%
decrease in precipitation and up to 3.6ËšC of temperature rise in A2
scenario</div>
