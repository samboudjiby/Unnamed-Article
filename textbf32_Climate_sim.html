<div class="ltx_p">The model analysis presented here is based on output from sixteen
coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) available
in Climate wizard tool, as listed in <b>Table 2 and 3</b>. Climate
Wizard is an analytical tool developed by the Nature Conservancy, the
University of Washington, and the University of Southern Mississippi
(http://www.climatewizard.org).
It’s a Web-based analysis engine that allows users to study climatic
data that have been downscaled from AOGCMs analysis (full descriptions
of all models are archived on the Climate Wizard Web site).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Climate Wizard tool allows an advanced watershed-scale analysis and
provides a range of possible outcomes, and users can analyze absolute
and percentage changes in annual, seasonal or monthly climate conditions
in graphic, or map form. Differences in their design cause these models
to produce a diversity of projections, especially for precipitation and
for variations among seasons, but the general direction of temperature
change is consistent among all of them [14-2].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">With the Climate Wizard custom analysis tool, a user can define a
relatively small geographic area of interest and conduct site-specific
analyses using both historical data and possible future conditions that
are based on low (B1), moderate (A1B) and high (A2) carbon emissions
scenarios. Trends are calculated from the 0.5-degree resolution CRU TS
2.1 dataset [25] for 1951 to 2002 to identify the rates of
temperature and precipitation change. (Girvetz et al., 2009) choose this
period because high levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gasses were
emitted during this 52-year period, it spans a long enough periods for
major environmental and ecological responses to climate change to have
occurred, and the climate data are more robust for this period than
earlier in the century. [14-3]recognize that the CRU TS 2.1 data
were developed using methods that limit their suitability for trend
analyses and therefore refers to [26] and discussion in Climate
Wizard website section “Use and misuse of climate data and analyses”),
and therefore the results should be interpreted in light of these
limits.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Lake Guiers Basin was selected for such custom analysis and climatic
projections have been simulated base on SRES emission scenario: B1, A1B
and A2 for mid-century (2040-2069) and end of century (2070-2099) as run
in climate wizard.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Considering ETpot, future shifts were analyzed through the
representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCP) from the latest
International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These scenarios are used
in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) data
set which included data for precipitation and potential evaporation.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Here, the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 were selected. Both scenarios have a
time span up to 2100. The RCP8.5 scenario assumes in addition a high
population and relatively slow income growth, as well as modest rates of
technology change and energy intensity improvements. These developments
will lead in long term high energy demand and greenhouse emissions in
absence of climate change policies (Riahi et al., 2011). The RCP4.5
scenario however is a stabilization scenario. On the basis of climate
policies that are introduced the greenhouse gas emissions will be
medium-low (Thomson et al., 2011)</div>


<div class="ltx_p">4. Results</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The results of climate extremes on the past and future climates are
presented first for air temperatures, secondly for rainfall and then for
evaporation.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">4.1. Climate Extremes: Past and future conditions</div>


<div class="ltx_p">4.1.1 Air temperature:</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The extreme event indices associated with maximum air temperature trends
show significant augmentation but the minimum air temperature show a
slight negative trends in Lake Guiers Basin. Thus, the DTR index, that
represents the daily thermal amplitude, is rising i.e., the maximum air
temperature increases at a rate higher than the minimum temperature.
This index is statistically significant (0.052°C/ year).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The TMAXmean and TMINmean indices that depict the annual average of the
maximum and minimum daily air temperatures, respectively, are presented
in Table 1. we can notice a warming trend statistically significant in
the current climate, TMAXmean (0.036°C /year) while TMINmean show a
negative trend (- 0.016°C/ year).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The TX90p (warm days), shown in figure 3, and TX10p (cold days) indices,
that show the percentage of days in the year on which the maximum air
temperature (TX) is, respectively, above the 90th (TX ˃ 35°C) percentile
and below the 10th percentile (TX ˂ 20°C ) show statistically
significant trend. TX90p trend is 0.392, so every year, on average an
additional 39% of days in the year are warm (~ 1.5 more
days per year) and hot (cold) days are becoming more (less) frequent,
(-18%) days / year.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Although the TN90p index (warm nights) and TN10p (cold nights) show
trends of an increase respectively, based on observation, they are not
statistically significant.</div>
