	abstract = {We conducted a controlled, prospective trial to evaluate the effectiveness of rapidly infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and salt-poor albumin into high-risk, premature infants in the first 2 hours of life. Fifty-three infants, randomized into one of four treatment groups, received 8 ml. per kilogram of a solution containing either (A) glucose in water, (B) salt-poor albumin, (C) NaHCO3, or (D) a combination of albumin and NaHCO3. After the initial infusion, the babies received no colloid or alkali solutions until 4 hours of age. We managed them supportively with warmth, appropriate oxygen administration, isotonic fluid infusion, and close monitoring. Among the infants who received alkali, 14 of 26 acquired the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), 11 died, and four had intracranial hemorrhage. Among babies who received no alkali, RDS occurred in 11 of 27, 5 died, and none had intracranial hemorrhage. These results do not support the common practice of rapidly infusing NaHCO3 into high-risk, premature infants, and they suggest that the early management of such infants needs renewed critical evaluation.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is altering terrestrial water and energy budgets, with subsequent impacts on surface and groundwater resources; recent studies have shown that local water management practices such as groundwater pumping and irrigation similarly alter terrestrial water and energy budgets over many agricultural regions, with potential feedbacks on weather and climate. Here we use a fully-integrated hydrologic model to directly compare effects of climate change and water management on terrestrial water and energy budgets of a representative agricultural watershed in the semi-arid Southern Great Plains, USA. At local scales, we find that the impacts of pumping and irrigation on latent heat flux, potential recharge and water table depth are similar in magnitude to the impacts of changing temperature and precipitation; however, the spatial distributions of climate and management impacts are substantially different. At the basin scale, the impacts on stream discharge and groundwater storage are remarkably similar. Notably, for the watershed and scenarios studied here, the changes in groundwater storage and stream discharge in response to a 2.5 °C temperature increase are nearly equivalent to those from groundwater-fed irrigation. Our results imply that many semi-arid basins worldwide that practice groundwater pumping and irrigation may already be experiencing similar impacts on surface water and groundwater resources to a warming climate. These results demonstrate that accurate assessment of climate change impacts and development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies must account for local water management practices.},

	abstract = {Climate model results provide the basis for projections of future climate change and increasing numbers of models are likely to contribute to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The heterogeneity in the new generation of climate models and an increasing emphasis on estimates of uncertainty in the projections raise questions about how best to evaluate and combine model results in order to improve the reliability of projections. Therefore, an Expert Meeting on Assessing and Combining Multi Model Climate Projections was organized by IPCC's Working Group I with contributions from Working Group II (WGI and WGII). The meeting was held in Boulder, Colorado, USA, from 25 to 27 January 2010. It is important for the success of the IPCC AR5 that this discussion took place early in the AR5 assessment cycle. The Expert Meeting provided a platform to explore the possibility of establishing a common framework that is applicable across the two IPCC Working Groups. The scientific core of this meeting report summarises the discussions and conclusions of the Expert Meeting. It contains a stand-alone Good Practice Guidance Paper for IPCC Lead Authors of AR5, as well as for scientists working in model intercomparison projects. The Guidance Paper briefly summarizes methods used in assessing the quality and reliability of climate model simulations and in combining results from multiple models, and provides recommendations for good practice in using multi-model ensembles. Applications include detection and attribution, model evaluation and global climate projections as well as regional projections relevant for impact and adaptation studies. This meeting report further includes the extended abstracts of the presentations and posters from the Expert Meeting as well as a noncomprehensive bibliography of relevant literature. (LN).},

	abstract = {In Africa, groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is forecast to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources in Africa, and groundwater storage is consequently omitted from assessments of freshwater availability. Here we present the first quantitative continent-wide maps of aquifer storage and potential borehole yields in Africa based on an extensive review of available maps, publications and data. We estimate total groundwater storage in Africa to be 0.66 million km3 (0.36–1.75 million km3). Not all of this groundwater storage is available for abstraction, but the estimated volume is more than 100 times estimates of annual renewable freshwater resources on Africa. Groundwater resources are unevenly distributed: the largest groundwater volumes are found in the large sedimentary aquifers in the North African countries Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Sudan. Nevertheless, for many African countries appropriately sited and constructed boreholes can support handpump abstraction (yields of 0.1–0.3 l s−1), and contain sufficient storage to sustain abstraction through inter-annual variations in recharge. The maps show further that the potential for higher yielding boreholes ( {\textgreater} 5 l s−1) is much more limited. Therefore, strategies for increasing irrigation or supplying water to rapidly urbanizing cities that are predicated on the widespread drilling of high yielding boreholes are likely to be unsuccessful. As groundwater is the largest and most widely distributed store of freshwater in Africa, the quantitative maps are intended to lead to more realistic assessments of water security and water stress, and to promote a more quantitative approach to mapping of groundwater resources at national and regional level.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is affecting Africa, as it is every other continent and region of the world.
The absolute poverty of a large proportion of the continent’s people renders them highly vulnerable to
changes in climate. Mitigation of climate change is a global imperative. However, numerous other changes
continue apace, notably population growth, natural resource degradation, and rural–urban migration.
Probably 50\% or more of the continent’s population rely on groundwater. This paper explores the relative
impacts of changes in climate, demography and land use/cover on groundwater resources and demands. It
concludes that the climate change impacts are likely to be significant, though uncertain in direction and
magnitude, while the direct and indirect impacts of demographic change on both water resources and water
demand are not only known with far greater certainty, but are also likely to be much larger. The combined
effects of urban population growth, rising food demands and energy costs, and consequent demand for fresh
water represent real cause for alarm, and these dwarf the likely impacts of climate change on groundwater
resources, at least over the first half of the 21st century.

presented. They are based on calculations of the global hydrological model WGHM
(WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model) which, for semi-arid and arid areas of the globe, was
tuned against independent point estimates of diffuse groundwater recharge. This has led to a
decrease of estimated groundwater recharge under semi-arid and arid conditions as compared
to the model results before tuning, and the new estimates are more similar to country level
data on groundwater recharge. Using the improved model, the impact of climate change on
groundwater recharge was simulated, applying two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios as
interpreted by two different climate models.},

especially pronounced in the tropics. The impact of changing rainfall intensities on
groundwater recharge remains, however, unclear. Analysis of a recently compiled data set of
coincidental, daily observations of rainfall and groundwater levels remote from abstraction for
four stations in the Upper Nile Basin over the period 1999–2008 shows that the magnitude of
observed recharge events is better related to the sum of heavy rainfalls, exceeding a threshold of
10 mm day
−1
, than to that of all daily rainfall events. Consequently, projected increases in
rainfall intensities as a result of global warming may promote rather than restrict groundwater
recharge in similar environments of the tropics. Further monitoring and research are required to
test the robustness of these ﬁndings, but the evidence presented is consistent with recent
modelling highlighting the importance of explicitly considering changing rainfall intensities in
the assessment of climate change impacts on groundwater recharge.},

	abstract = {Climate change will lead to significant changes of groundwater recharge and thus renewable groundwater resources. Using the global water resources and use model WaterGAP, the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge and the number of affected people was computed for four climate scenarios by two climate models. Vulnerability of humans to decreased groundwater resources depends on both the degree of decrease and the sensitivity of the human system to the decrease. For each grid cell, a sensitivity index composed of a water scarcity indicator, an indicator for dependence of water supply on groundwater and the Human Development Index was quantified. Combining per cent groundwater recharge decrease with the sensitivity index, global maps of vulnerability to the impact of decreased groundwater recharge in the 2050s were derived. In the A2 (B2) emissions scenario, 18.4–19.3\% (16.1–18.1\%) of the global population of 10.7 (9.1) billion would be affected by groundwater recharge decreases of at least 10\%, and 4.8–5.7\% (3.8–3.8\%) of the global population would be in the two highest vulnerability classes. The highest vulnerabilities are found at the North African rim of the Mediterranean Sea, in southwestern Africa, in northeastern Brazil and in the central Andes, which are areas of moderate to high sensitivity. For most of the areas with high population density and high sensitivity, model results indicate that groundwater recharge is unlikely to decrease by more than 10\% until the 2050s. However, a fifth to a third of the population may be affected by a groundwater recharge increase of more than 10\%, with negative impacts in the case of shallow water tables. The spatial distribution of vulnerability, even at the continental scale, differs more strongly between the two climate models than between the two emissions scenarios.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The Senegal River Basin (SRB), located in the Sahel region of West Africa, is simultaneously undergoing fundamental environmental, hydrologic, and socioeconomic transitions. The trination (Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali) river basin development authority, the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS), is attempting to execute a shift to irrigated riceproduction for domestic consumption in the river basin in order to ease the severe foreign exchange shortfalls these riparian nations face. With the recent completion of the Manantali and Diama dams, year-round irrigated agriculture is now possible in the SRB. The full agricultural developmentpotential of the SRB is constrained, however, by the basin's limited water resources. Significantly, a time series analysis of Senegal River hydrology has provided powerful evidence that the prolonged Sahelian drought may be permanent. The negative impact of the state-imposed rice production policy compounds the severe effects of the drought on the river basin ecology. Rice production in the arid river valley has been a financial and social failure. Irrigated rice projects suffer a high rate of abandonment and have intensified the desertification process in the river valley. As an alternate use of the basin's scarce water resources, an agricultural development policy based on village-scale irrigation projects and intensive, irrigated agroforestry projects has been proposed. Village-scale irrigation is dedicated to low-water-consumption cereal grain crops and is managed by traditional sociopolitical structures. The agroforestry production system analyzed has the dual objectives of using irrigation to reestablish a protective biomass cover in the desertifying river valley and of reversing the drought-induced migration from rural to urban areas. A comparative river system simulation study was conducted to analyze the effects of both the rice production development policy (policy RP) and the natural resources management policy (policy NRM) on the SRB's full agricultural development potential. The simulation study compared three alternate hydrologic scenarios using, (I) the predrought era, (2) the 1970's level drought and (3) the 1980's level drought. Principles of dynamic programming were applied to Manantali reservoir management to optimize water allocation in each scenario. All the hydrologic scenarios generated showed that the lower overall water demand pattern exerted by policy NRM allows a higher full agricultural development potential than does policy RP.},

	abstract = {Groundwater plays a major, if often unrecognized, role in both hydro-
logic and human systems. The majority of the world’s drinking water
probably comes from groundwater, and in the last half century, there has
been an amazing, if largely ignored, boom in agricultural groundwater
use that has provided improved livelihoods and food security to billions
of farmers and consumers. However, increased use of groundwater has
also created problems, and there are fears—sometimes challenged—
that the boom may soon turn to bust. This article reviews the recent
literature on the geographic and temporal dimensions of groundwater
use and the range of technological and institutional approaches which
have been applied in attempts at its management. It then examines the
key reasons the resource has proven so difficult to manage and concludes
that, in many cases, the most promising solutions may lie outside the
groundwater sector and within a broader approach to resource systems.},

probably intensify under
climate change
as more frequent and
intense climate extremes
(droughts and ﬂoods)
increase variability
in precipitation, soil
moisture and surface
water. Here we
critically review recent research assessing
the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and
human-induced processes as well as
through groundwater driven feedbacks on the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and
challenges of using and
sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of
groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.},

The downscaled
climate is used as input
to the WetSpa

hydrological model, a physically-distributed rainfall–runoff model, which was used to simulate the resulting 
hydrological changes. Downscaled climate shows an increase in precipitation in the wet seasons (March–
May; October–December) ranging from 30\% in the 2020s to over 100\% in the 2080s. The corresponding
rise in temperature ranges between 1 and 4°C. These changes are shown to give rise to intensification of the
hydrological cycle. The mean annual daily baseflow for the current period of 157 mm/year (69\% of discharge),
is
expected to increase
by
20–80\%
between
the

techniques. These renewable waters form the basis of sustainable development in areas such as the Sahel.
Based on the field evidence of water scarcity, new approaches are needed in management and education to
adapt to the current limited resources in the face of changing climates.

	abstract = {In Africa, groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is forecast to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources in Africa, and groundwater storage is consequently omitted from assessments of freshwater availability. Here we present the first quantitative continent-wide maps of aquifer storage and potential borehole yields in Africa based on an extensive review of available maps, publications and data. We estimate total groundwater storage in Africa to be 0.66 million km3 (0.36–1.75 million km3). Not all of this groundwater storage is available for abstraction, but the estimated volume is more than 100 times estimates of annual renewable freshwater resources on Africa. Groundwater resources are unevenly distributed: the largest groundwater volumes are found in the large sedimentary aquifers in the North African countries Libya, Algeria, Egypt and Sudan. Nevertheless, for many African countries appropriately sited and constructed boreholes can support handpump abstraction (yields of 0.1–0.3 l s−1), and contain sufficient storage to sustain abstraction through inter-annual variations in recharge. The maps show further that the potential for higher yielding boreholes ( {\textgreater} 5 l s−1) is much more limited. Therefore, strategies for increasing irrigation or supplying water to rapidly urbanizing cities that are predicated on the widespread drilling of high yielding boreholes are likely to be unsuccessful. As groundwater is the largest and most widely distributed store of freshwater in Africa, the quantitative maps are intended to lead to more realistic assessments of water security and water stress, and to promote a more quantitative approach to mapping of groundwater resources at national and regional level.},

In agricultural areas, such changes in climate may require increased irrigation, putting stress on existing water supplies. In this study, a regional-scale numerical groundwater model was developed for the Oliver region of the south Okanagan, British Columbia, Canada, to simulate the impacts of future predicted climate change on groundwater. In future time periods (the 2050s and 2080s), the most noticeable change in the water budget is the increased contribution of recharge to the annual water budget, estimated at 1.2\% (2050s) and 1.4\% (2080s) of the total annual budget relative to the current conditions. This increase is related primarily to increases to irrigation return flow resulting from higher irrigation needs under warmer temperatures and a longer growing season. Increases in recharge and irrigation return flow will result in higher water tables with future climate conditions, particularly in the irrigation districts. Median value increases in groundwater level of up to 0.7 m by the 2080s are estimated.},

	abstract = {Groundwater has been used for domestic and irrigation needs from time immemorial. Yet its nature and occurrence have always possessed a certain mystery because water below the land surface is invisible and relatively inaccessible. The influence of this mystery lingers in some tenets that govern groundwater law. With the birth of modern geology during the late nineteenth century, groundwater science became recognized in its own right. Over the past two centuries, groundwater has lost its shroud of mystery, and its scientific understanding has gradually grown hand-in-hand with its development for human use. Groundwater is a component of the hydrological cycle, vital for human sustenance. Its annual renewability from precipitation is limited, and its chemical quality is vulnerable to degradation by human action. In many parts of the world, groundwater extraction is known to greatly exceed its renewability. Consequently, its rational management to benefit present and future generations is a matter of deep concern for many nations. Groundwater management is a challenging venture, requiring an integration of scientific knowledge with communal will to adapt to constraints of a finite common resource. As scientists and policy makers grapple with the tasks of groundwater management, it is instructive to reflect on the evolution of groundwater knowledge from its initial phase of demystification at the beginning of the nineteenth century, through successive phases of technological conquest, scientific integration, discovery of unintended consequences and the present recognition of an imperative for judicious management. The following retrospective provides a broad context for unifying the technical contributions that make up this focus issue on groundwater resources, climate and vulnerability.},

	abstract = {The direct and indirect impact of the recent hydraulic installations on the River Senegal on Lake Guiers are obvious. The hydrological regime of the lake was very irregular before the dams were brought into operation. The lake is now characterized by very stable water levels. These new conditions prevent cultivation of traditional recession crops which have been replaced by irrigated crops. The water quality of the lake has been modified. Mean salinity has decreased and the significant interannual and intraannual variations noted before 1986 are now far less pronounced. The new hydrological regime of the lake and its low salt content have encouraged aquatic vegetation to grow rapidly. This vegetation used to be controlled by the periodic partial drying of the flooding zone and specific water quality conditions at certain times of the year. Pistia stratiotes and Typha australis are now increasing rapidly. This proliferation of aquatic plants has no doubt accelerated the rapid spread of schistosomiasis, which now affects 80\% of the population of some lakeside villages. The management of Lake Guiers requires an integrated quantitative and qualitative approach. A water management model has been perfected. It permits an assessment of the effects of various quantitative reservoir management options on the salinity of the water. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using remote sensing based land cover change analysis, archival data, national and international statistical data, and household interviews, we analyze the drivers of environmental change in Eastern Saloum in Central East Senegal as well as the local perceptions of these changes and adaptation. Being part of the ground nut basin, Eastern Saloum has witnessed rapid environmental degradation caused by the conversion of forest and savanna areas to agricultural land during the last 20–30 years and by a combination of decline in precipitation, soil degradation, a diversity of policies with little concern for the environment, fluctuating markets and population pressure. Farmers perceive the environmental change mainly as land degradation and poor soil fertility, though recent extensification of agriculture counters this effect and has led to increased vegetation cover in marginal areas. They identified erratic climate, agricultural policies, insufficient food production and desire to increase income as the main drivers of change in the area. We conclude that while climate variability has influenced environmental change in the area, various types of State interventions in agriculture and global market fluctuations appear to have been the main underlying causes of environmental degradation.},

multi-ethnic, multicultural population where livestock
outnumber people. It runs through sub-Saharan Africa in a
mostly desert region characterized by water scarcity and subsistence
economies. The Organization for the Development of the Senegal River
(OMVS) was created in 1972 with a mandate to ensure food security
and harmony among all riparian users. Thanks to the construction of
two main dams providing energy, irrigated agriculture and year-round
navigation – and to an original management approach based on a
concept of ‘optimal distribution among users’ rather than volumetric
water withdrawals – the area is gradually developing. Ironically, dam
construction has brought problems as well as benefits, and the major
concern is water-related diseases.},

	doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.54.4.665},
	abstract = {Today, groundwater is the source of about one third of global water withdrawals and provides
drinking water for a large portion of the global population. In many regions it is subject to stress with respect
to both quantity and quality. Hence, it is of utmost importance to improve our knowledge about the impacts
of climate change on groundwater. Climate change will affect groundwater recharge, i.e. long-term average
renewable groundwater resources, via increases in mean temperature, precipitation variability and sea level,
as well as via changes in mean precipitation (increasing in some areas and decreasing in others). Over many
areas groundwater recharge is projected to increase in the warming world (though less than river runoff), but
many semi-arid areas that suffer from water stress already may face decreased groundwater recharge. The
sea level rise that is likely to occur during the 21st century might leave many flat coral islands without a
reliable groundwater source. However, in coastal areas with a land surface elevation of a few metres or
more, groundwater availability is more strongly impacted by changes in groundwater recharge than sea-level
rise. Under climate change, reliable surface water supply is likely to decrease due to increased temporal 
variations of river flow that are caused by increased precipitation variability and decreased snow/ice storage. 
Under these circumstances, it might be beneficial to take advantage of the storage capacity of groundwater
and increase groundwater withdrawals. However, this option is only sustainable where groundwater
withdrawals remain well below groundwater recharge. Groundwater is not likely to ease freshwater stress in
those areas where climate change is projected to decrease groundwater recharge (e.g. Northeast Brazil and
the Mediterranean basin).},

	abstract = {For millennia, India used surface storage and gravity flow to water crops. During the last 40 years, however, India has witnessed a decline in gravity-flow irrigation and the rise of a booming 'water-scavenging' irrigation economy through millions of small, private tubewells. For India, groundwater has become at once critical and threatened. Climate change will act as a force multiplier; it will enhance groundwater's criticality for drought-proofing agriculture and simultaneously multiply the threat to the resource. Groundwater pumping with electricity and diesel also accounts for an estimated 16–25 million mt of carbon emissions, 4–6\% of India's total. From a climate change point of view, India's groundwater hotspots are western and peninsular India. These are critical for climate change mitigation as well as adaptation. To achieve both, India needs to make a transition from surface storage to 'managed aquifer storage' as the center pin of its water strategy with proactive demand- and supply-side management components. In doing this, India needs to learn intelligently from the experience of countries like Australia and the United States that have long experience in managed aquifer recharge.},

The objectives of this Technical Paper ... are: to improve our understanding of the links between both natural and anthropogenically induced climate change, its impacts, and adaptation and mitigation response options, on the one hand, and water-related issues, on the other; to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the implications of climate change and climate change response options for water resources, as well as the implications for water resources of various climate change scenarios and climate change response options, including associated synergies and trade-offs."--P. 3-7.},
