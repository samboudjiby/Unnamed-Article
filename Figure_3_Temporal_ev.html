<div class="ltx_p">The WSDI indicator (heat waves), which represents the maximum number of
consecutive days in the year when the maximum air temperature is above
the 90th percentile, shows a statistically significant positive trend
for Lake Guiers Basin (0.65 day/year). These heat waves tend to be more
frequent and to last longer by the late 21st century, as stated
[27].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Table 1: Definitions and magnitudes of the climate extremes indicators
related to precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperature observed
at Lake Guiers Basin. P-values of up to 0.05 indicate statistical
significance. RR is the daily rainfall rate. A wet day has RR â‰¥ 1 mm. A
dry day has RR &lt; 1mm. TX and TN are daily maximum and minimum
air temperature respectively.</div>
