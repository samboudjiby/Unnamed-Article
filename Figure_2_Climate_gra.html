Area, Senegal. Data source: (http://de.climate-data.org; average
1982-2012)</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Beyond that, the region is affected by droughts since the 1970s. Their
seasonal and episodic variation is due to the dependency on the monsoon.
Arthurton et al. (2002) show that the isohyets in Senegal move
southwards. While the isohyet of 400mm/a crossed the Lake Guiers region
from 1931-60 it moved around 50km southwards in the observed period of
1961-90. Annual precipitation is consequently &lt;400mm/year in
Lake Guiers region and the Ferlo valley.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">3. Materials and Methods</div>


<div class="ltx_p">For the purposes of this study only three climatic factors temperature,
precipitation and potential evaporation will be discussed in detail.
Other factors, such as wind and humidity, are potentially important as
well, but they are beyond the scope of this study.</div>
