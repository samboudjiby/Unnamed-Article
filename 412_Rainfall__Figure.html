<div class="ltx_p">Figure 4 features total annual rainfall (PRCPTOT) of wet days (days when
rainfall is greater than or equal to 1 mm) and the total annual rainfall
of days when it is above the 95th percentile of wet days (R95p).
Initially, a high inter annual variability is noted in the observational
data. There is an increasing PRCPTOT trend on a rate of +6.17 mm/year
particularly since 2000s. This trend is statistically significant. These
results agree with those obtained in Sahel zone by [30] in which
PRCPTOT decline between 1970 -2000 but get recovery slowly between 2000
and 2010.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Also Figure 5 illustrates the same trends. It shows the SPI
(Standardized Precipitation Index) per year since 1955 in the Lake
Guiers catchment. We can notice that since the 1970s, the region is
affected by dry years, which reached its last maximum in 1983. The
decade since 2000 is wetter than the decades before with a peak in 2010.
However the years since 2010 are normal years again. With regard to the
precipitation, the climate varies with a tendency to extremes.</div>
