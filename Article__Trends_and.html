<b>Abstract:</b> The Lake Guiers Basin is an important water resource
for the northern part of Senegal especially for agriculture and water
supply of the capital Dakar. In this study, climate change over the
Basin as computed by sixteen (16) different general circulation models
(GCMs) has been examined considering IPCC climate scenarios A2, A1B and
B1. Observed rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration data during
1988-2012 were assessed, as well as derived indices to bridge the gap
between global climate change and local impacts. Future shifts in
precipitation and temperature were analyzed through the Climate Wizard
tool and projections of evapotranspiration were analyzed through the
representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCPs) used in the
Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) data set. A
warming trend is noted (both in past and future projections), with
increasing maximum air temperature and temperature extremes. A
statistically significant rise of 1.05°C occurred during the last two
decades. Warm days and heat waves are becoming more (less) frequent each
year. All models predicted a trend of rising annual mean temperatures.
An increase of 2.17°C by mid-century and 3.61°C by end century is
expected in A2 scenario. With regards to rainfall, increasing trend on
annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT) has been noted (+6.17mm/year) for
Lake Guiers Basin. Heavy rainfall events R95p; R99p has increased
respectively of (+5.78mm/year and +1.709mm/year) and has become stronger
during 1988-2012. However a decreasing trend is noted in all scenarios
for the rest of the century, although the magnitudes of change varied
among models and emissions scenarios. This trend is more marked by end
century in A1B scenario (-11.56%) and A2 (-15.43%). Considering
evapotranspiration, the loss of water is high in Lake Guiers with a mean
of 5.74 mm/day (2102.43mm/year) from 1988 -2011. By end century an
increasing trend (2538.80mm/year) is projected under RCP 4.5 scenario
and (2916.82mm/year) under RCP 8.5 scenario. The climatic water balance
show an high annual estimated deficit (1781.43 mm/year)</div>

<div class="ltx_p">1. Introduction</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The scientific community agrees, with a high level of confidence, that
human-generated greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere and
are causing significant changes in the global climate system,
particularly during the last several decades [1]. Climate models
that simulate complex interactions among air, ocean and land masses can
provide useful insights into the general direction of future climate
change. Such models allow us to predict basic air temperature and
precipitation patterns on a broad, global scale [1-2], but they lack
the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to fully anticipate the
effects of rising global temperatures associated with increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations and to bridge the gap between global
climate change and local impacts [2].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Climate simulations incorporating (GCMs) indicate that a warmer climate
could result in a decrease in high-frequency temperature variability and
in an increase in the proportion of precipitation occurring in extreme
events [3]. Therefore understanding climate change demands attention
to changes in climate variability and extremes. Thus, climate change
detection and projection based on the analysis of extreme event indices
are great importance to provide information on observed and projected
extremes and to prepare strategies to adapt to climate change. This
detection type of study requires high-quality and long-term observed
data, which are not always available particularly in local scale.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Among others, such studies have been undertaken at regional level by the
African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis program (AMMA): ([4];
[5]; [6]; [7]; [8]) to better understand and model the
influence of the spatio-temporal variability of surface processes on the
atmospheric circulation patterns and the regional water cycle.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In Senegal studies such as [9], examined the inter-annual
variability of seven rainfall indices in order to update recent climate
evolution in Senegal and found out an inconsistent linear trends in
Senegalese rainfall indices from 1950 to 2007. [10], studied the
rainfall variability in Senegal and analyze its relationships with the
West African region and the global climate. One of their conclusion they
point out that a strong agreement exists between the empirical
orthogonal function (EOFs) rainfall total amounts and the number of
rainy days for Senegal. [11], analyzed recent climate observations
and multimodal projection for Senegal.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The number of analyses of climate observations, climate model
experiments, climate model projections, and climate change impacts
studies in Senegal is significantly limited.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Lake Guiers, which plays an economic and an ecological leading role in
Senegal; such studies were not yet undertaken. This deficit in knowledge
and information doubtlessly limits capacity for climate related risk
assessment, adaptation planning, and decision making.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Thus, a detailed investigation of the behavior of extreme climate event
indicators and the projections of futures climate condition will be
tremendously useful. Even though information currently available from
GCMs is inadequate (and highly variable) for most operational and design
aspects of water management decisions. However, there are ways to use
the relatively crude information (in terms of the specific needs of
hydraulic structural design), under certain circumstances, to improve
insights for longer-term watershed planning and vulnerability analysis
[12].</div>


<div class="ltx_p">This study investigates climate change detection and projections for
Lake Guiers Basin by analyzing precipitation, evaporation and air
temperature-related to observed extremes. The aim of this study is to
provide information on observed and projected extremes in Lake Guiers
Basin, in support of its water resource managers, for an efficient
long-term planning and management. Observed extreme events trends coming
from 8 weather stations located within Lake Guiers are analyzed using
RClimDex (1.0) program [13]. The projections of future climatic
conditions were generated through Climate Wizard, [14].</div>

<div class="ltx_p">2.1. Hydrology</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Lake Guiers is located in the north of Senegal on the downstream of the
Ferlo hydrological Basin. In this study, Lake Guiers Basin and Ferlo
Basin are used both as same (figure 1). It’s a huge basin of 45119
square kilometers. According to [15], it covers
(~43,280 km2) and to [16], it is estimate to (22,330
km2). Dozens of ephemeral streams flow into the Lake, carrying less than
7% of the water that enters into the lake [17]. It is connected to
the Senegal River by the Taouey channel at Richard Toll. Originally
Taouey was a winding stream of 26 Km, rectified by a channel long to 17
km. It supplies amounts 88% of the total water in Lake Guiers from
Senegal River [17-2]. The Lake is 53.5 km long and up to 7.75 km
wide, with a surface area of 273.83 square kilometers (measured and
calculated with Google earth Pro and GIS). Its maximum depth is 4m and
average depth is 2 m [17-3]. It drains via Merinaghene dyke to the
south in Ferlo valley.</div>
