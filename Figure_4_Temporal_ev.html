line) indices, both in mm, during 1988-2012, observed for Lake Guiers,
Basin</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The R95p index (Figure 4) shows a statistically significant increase
(+5.78 mm/year).This implies that at Lake Guiers Basin either heavy
rainfall events have become stronger, i.e., associated with a higher
volume of rainfall each year, or they are becoming more frequent, or
both. The R99p index shows the same R95p behavior, i.e. positive
(1.70mm/year).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The RX5day and RX1day indicators that show the accumulated maximum
rainfall in 1 day and in 5 days, respectively, are rising (2.87 mm/ day)
and (1.57 mm/day) with statistical significance. In general, it is noted
that the current rainfall climate positive trends are more marked.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Figure 5: Six months SPI in Lake Guiers Basin. Here, the 6-months SPI
compares the precipitation for
June-July-August-September-October-November with the same 6-months
period over the historical record. A normal year is defined with an
Index between -0.99 and 0.99, an Index ≥ 1 is classified as a wet year,
while an Index of ≤ -1 is classified as a dry year.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The R25 mm indicator, illustrating the number of days in the year on
which the total daily rainfall was above 25 mm, shows statistically
significant positive trends (+0.14 day/year). This confirms that
moderate to heavy rain events are becoming more frequent every year.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The CDD and CWD indices that illustrate the maximum number of
consecutive dry and wet days, respectively, show negative trend
(-0.84mm/day) and positive trend (0.077 mm/day) in the Basin.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Table 1 shows a summary of the trends observed for the climate extremes
indicator to rainfall, maximum air temperature and minimum air
temperature that were analyzed earlier. It is noted that trends are
significant to air temperature and precipitation, except TN10p and
TN90p. Besides inter-annual variability of climate is higher for
precipitation than for temperature.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">As we said previously, precipitation is extremely variable in space and
time, and future precipitation patterns are therefore more difficult to
model and predict than temperature.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">In regard to precipitation projection, most, but not all, of the AOGCMs
available through Climate Wizard predict a significant decrease in
annual precipitation in Lake Guiers Basin. Considering models ensemble
average, a decreasing trend in noted is all scenarios for the rest of
the century. This trend is more marked by end century in A1B scenario
(-11.56%) and A2 (-15.43%).</div>


<div class="ltx_p">However some models predict an increase in annual precipitation between
1 to 48% in B1 scenario and 3 to 17% in A2 scenario. For i-e while
ECHAM5-MPI model project decreasing trends in precipitation up to
(-23%) under A2 emissions scenarios by the end of the century,
MRI-CGCM2.3.2 5 model project an increasing tend up to (10%). Figure 6
show the difference between ECHAM5-MPI projections and MRI-CGCM2.3.2.5.</div>

AOGCMs through Climate Wizard covering mid-century (2040-2069) and end
century (2070-2099). SRES emission scenario: B1; A1B, A2. Most of the
models project a decrease of precipitation and some models projected an
increase of rainfall. Highlighted cells indicated models which predicted
increase of rainfall in all SRES scenario in mid and end century</div>
