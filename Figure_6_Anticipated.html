2099 in Lake Guiers Basin under the A2 emissions scenario, as projected
by the ECHAM5-MPI on (left) and MRI-CGCM2.3.2 5 on (right). Areas that
are blue are projected to increase, and areas that are yellow to red are
projected to decrease. While ECHAM5-MPI project decreasing trends in
precipitation under A2 high future emissions scenarios, MRI-CGCM2.3.2 5
project increasing precipitation under A2</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Different models in the ensemble project a wide range of changes in
precipitation for Lake Guiers Basin, but tend towards decreases,
particularly in the wet season, JAS.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">Projected JJA changes ranges from -41% to +32 % for A2 scenario and
-40% to +12% for B2 scenario by mid-century. However, by end century,
projected JJA changes ranges from -61% to 45% for A2 scenario and
-39% to 54% for B1 scenario. (Figure 8)</div>

(map on left) and 2070 and 2099 (map on right) in Lake Guiers Basin.
Models: Ensemble Average, SRES emission scenario: A2, A1B and B1. Areas
that are blue are projected to increase, and areas that are yellow to

<div class="ltx_p">Projected SON changes ranges from 32% to +46 % for A2 scenario and
-24% to +34% for B2 scenario by mid-century. However by end century
projected SON changes ranges from -48% to 43% for A2 scenario and
-31% to 56% for B1 scenario (figure 9 and 10). Seasonally, this varies
between tendencies to decrease in SON and to increase in JJA.</div>


<div class="ltx_p">The range of projections from different models in the ensemble, however,
includes both increases and decreases in all seasons.</div>
